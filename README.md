#Exploring Google Trends

Uses the IPython notebook to visualize and analyze data collected from Google Trends. 

For the future: Will try to use the [unofficial Python Google Trends API](https://github.com/suryasev/unofficial-google-trends-api) to help gather the data using any specificed keyword.
